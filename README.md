Simple Polls App and some Robot Framework tests for it

Polls app was created for to do an experiment on maintaining automated UI tests, when SUT changes. In this experiment two different test automation tools, Robot Framework and Testim, was compared by using metrics like maintenance time and correctness of tests. Robot Framework and Testim tests were made to test exactly same things in Polls app.  

Polls app is written with Django Framework. Database is Postgresql.

Polls app, Robot Framework tests and test log are in this repository. Unfortunately tests and reports from Testim-tool could not be exported from Testim. Functions for exporting these is not included or at least not included in free-trial version of Testim. Repository has only pictures from Testim tests and test runs. Testim is very easy to use though and this kind of tests can be done in few minutes, without coding. Only maintenance requires some actual writing or "coding", when locators need to be updated.
